# Codewars

I LOVE codewars! This is a repo of all of the coding problems I've done on a daily basis since I started doing them in July of 2023. The first 4000 lines of code/coding problems I completed are located in main.js, and the more recent problems are stored in individual .js and .cs files. Feel free to take a look!
